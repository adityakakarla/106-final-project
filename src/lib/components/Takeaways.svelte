            Heart rate is a weird indicator for test performance.

        <h2 class='text-xl font-medium mt-3 mb-3'>
            High performers and low performers tend to have high average heart rates. On the other hand, middle performers tend to have low average heart rates.

            In other words, you're probably stressing out if you're doing well or doing poorly. But if you're in the middle, you're probably just chilling.
